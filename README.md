# todo_app in progress

####### This is a full-stack JavaScript Todo-App, which allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, and mark them as completed or incomplete. The app has two main components: the backend and the frontend. The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js and it provides RESTful APIs for the frontend to interact with. The frontend is built using React.js and Redux.js, and it consumes the backend APIs to perform CRUD operations on the tasks.
